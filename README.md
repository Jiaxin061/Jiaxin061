## Reflection
* **Assignment 1**

> My visit to NALI 2023 was a transformative experience, providing a profound insight of the vital role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the realm of modern education. It showcased diverse needs met by ICT, including Augmented Reality (AR) technology, virtual classrooms via social media, efficient information management through databases, and others. These prompted me to explore how the features of ICT could be incorporated into my own learning experience.


* **Assignment 2**
  
> The industrial talk by Clarity Techworks Sdn. Bhd., providing a comprehensive overview of ICT jobs within a tech company. It focus on the diverse job scopes, required criteria, and essential technological abilities. Strong problem-solving skills, adaptability, and effective communication were highlighted as essential attributes across various roles. Clarity Techworks stressed the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends. They encouraged students to engage in practical experiences, such as internships or personal projects, to enhance their skills and build a robust portfolio. Overall, the talk is essential for students a s provided a comprehensive understanding of ICT jobs in a tech company.


* **Assignment 3**
  
> The industrial visit to UTM Digital, coupled with insightful virtual talk provided students with a comprehensive understanding of UTM Digital's organizational structure and the diverse range of services they offer. This hands-on experience allowed students to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts learned in Technology and Information Systems (TIS) lessons and their practical implementation in a live scenario. Witnessing the physical servers and data management systems in action at UTM Digital brought to life the complexities involved in maintaining a robust digital infrastructure. The practical exposure served as a catalyst for students to explore the vast possibilities within the realm of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Additionally, it underscored the importance of such practical experiences in fostering a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of ICT.


* **Assignment 4**

> The industrial talk by Ms. Qistina Batrisyia Binti Azman Shah, a Professional in AI Operation at Credence, a TM Subsidiary, provided a fascinating insight into the realm of system development. Her insightful sharing session delved into the intricacies of data resources, the data manipulation process, and data modeling. The introduction of technology and tools used in system development served as a practical guide for students eager to prepare relevant skills and equipping for the dynamic landscape of industries. The talk not only educated students about the description of system development but also served as a catalyst for cultivating students to delve deeper into the world of data technology


* **PC Assemble**

> The PC assembly lab session offered a hands-on experience that significantly enhanced my understanding of hardware components, particularly the system unit. This practical opportunity to assemble and disassemble a PC was invaluable in translating theoretical knowledge into tangible skills. I was able to identify and connect various components, such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage devices, with a clearer understanding of their roles and interactions. The hands-on opportunity to assemble and disassemble a PC deepened my understanding of hardware components.
